# Meme Generator – Instructions

The goal of this project is to build a "meme generator" – a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote. It’s not that simple though! Your content team spent countless hours writing quotes in a variety of filetypes. You could manually copy and paste these quotes into one standard format – but you’re going to over-engineer a solution to load quotes from each file.


The application you build must:

    - Interact with a variety of complex filetypes. This emulates the kind of data you’ll encounter in a data engineering role.
    - Load quotes from a variety of filetypes (PDF, Word Documents, CSVs, Text files).
    - Load, manipulate, and save images.
    - Accept dynamic user input through a command-line tool and a web service. This emulates the kind of work you’ll encounter as a full stack developer.

This project will give you a hands-on opportunity to practice what you've learned in this course, such as:

    - Object-oriented thinking in Python, including abstract classes, class methods, and static methods.
    - DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principles of class and method design.
    - Working with modules and packages in Python.

As you're building your project, be sure to demonstrate coding best practices for style and documentation. Ensure your code, docstrings, and comments adhere to PEP 8 Standards.

You'll find detailed instructions on the following pages. And while you work through the instructions, you can also check your work against the project rubric to see exactly what your reviewer will be looking for when they grade your project.
